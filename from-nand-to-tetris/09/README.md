### Playing with the Jack language

Wrote a small JACK program in multiple ".jack" files.
To compile the program to byte code (".vm" files), move all the "helper .vm"
files in "tools/OS" to the folder where the JACK program is located and run:
`./tools/JackCompiler.sh 09/GolfSimulator`

Then to run the program launch the Virtual Machine Emulator (VMEmulator) and
upload the folder with all the ".vm" files
