### Assembler

In order to use the assembler run:
`python assembler.py <target>`.

The target needs to be a ".asm" file and the output will be a ".hack" file

To test the assembler load both the target file and the output of running the
assembler with the target file to the Assembler (tool provided), then the
Assembler will compare the the suplied output is valid.
